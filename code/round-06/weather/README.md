# Weather

In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides hourly XML feeds of conditions at 1,800 locations (http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/). For example, http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KDTO.xml.

Write an application that fetches this data, parses it, and displays it in a nice format. (Hint: You might not have to download a library to handle XML parsing.)
